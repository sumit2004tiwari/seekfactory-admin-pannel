Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><h2>Why do we use it?</h2><p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><p><br /></p><h2>Where does it come from?</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p><p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p><h2>Where can I get some?</h2><p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p><p>paragraphswordsbyteslists</p><p>Start with 'Lorem<br />ipsum dolor sit amet...'</p><hr /><p><strong>Donate:</strong> If you use this site regularly and would like to help keep the site on the Internet, please consider donating a small sum to help pay for the hosting and bandwidth bill.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"</p><h3><strong>Section 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC</strong></h3><p>\"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

The game has truly become a religion, seeping into the warp and weft of our social fabric.

It will help them to participate in various essay writing competitions.</p><h3><strong>History of Cricket</strong></h3><p>Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world after football. The history of cricket began in the late 16th century. Cricket originated in south-east England and became popular in the country in the 18th century. The sport got global recognition in the 19th and 20th centuries. International cricket matches started in the 19th century. The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs the sport of cricket.</p><h3><strong>A Short Para on Cricket Match</strong></h3><p>Cricket is a game between two teams of eleven players. Each team bats once to score as many runs as possible, while the other team bowls to restrict the number of runs scored. Cricket is usually played on a circular or an oval field with a pitch placed in the middle of the field. The pitch has three sticks at each end, known as the wickets. The pitch is 22 yards in length. The bowler bowls from one end of the pitch while the batsman (striker) tries to hit the ball from the other end. There is another batsman (non-striker) waiting at the bowler’s end. The batsman scores the run by hitting the ball. The aim of the bowler is to get the batsman out while giving away the least runs possible. At the same time, the batsmen want to make as many runs as possible. The team which makes the most runs wins.</p><p>The popularity of sports in India is largely driven by Cricket. Cricket is a game that has its own unique appeal as it is played within the rules and laws, and it creates the Spirit of the Game among the players. Any action that indicates any abuse or unfair play causes injury to the game itself. Playing a cricket match is a very enjoyable experience which involves a great deal of physical activities.</p><h3><strong>The Popularity of Cricket in India</strong></h3><p>Cricket is the most popular sport in India and has a large fan following. Television and media coverage has also contributed to its popularity. One hundred and fifty years ago, the Parsis, who were the first Indian cricketers, had to struggle to find an open space to play a cricket match. Now, the global market is supporting cricket players. Currently, the Indian players are the best paid and are supported with all facilities so they can play the game at their best.</p><p>Children from small villages and towns can easily watch cricket matches on television and they imitate their heroes. This has also increased the youth’s love and passion for cricket. That’s why we can see that in every street, children play cricket matches on Sundays. Early exposure to cricket is a great help in the making of a successful player. We never know who will be the next Kapil Dev or Sachin Tendulkar.</p>",
